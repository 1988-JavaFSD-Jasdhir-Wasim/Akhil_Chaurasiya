# üìÇ **[Your Name] - Java Development Challenges**

### Description:
This repository contains coding challenges and project activities as part of my training program. The tasks cover core Java collections, CRUD operations, RESTful services, MySQL integration, Spring Boot, and Servlets. The code implements solutions to various problems, focusing on building scalable Java-based applications.

## üîë **Key Features**:

- **Core Java Collections**: Efficient usage of collections like `HashSet`, `ArrayList`, `LinkedHashMap` to solve real-world problems.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities in a variety of applications.
- **RESTful Services**: Building and consuming RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.
- **MySQL Integration**: Managing data persistence with MySQL databases.
- **Spring Boot**: Backend development using Spring Boot for creating REST APIs.
- **Servlets**: Web application handling with Java Servlets.

## üìù **Day 1 - Coding Challenges and Projects**:

### Coding Challenges:
1. **Scenario 1: Choosing the Right Collection**
   - You are developing an application where you need to store a collection of unique usernames. These usernames will be frequently checked for existence and occasionally added or removed. Which Java collection would you choose and why?

2. **Scenario 2: Maintaining Order**
   - You are developing a system to process student grades. Each student has a unique student ID, and you need to store grades in the order they are received. Which Java collection would be appropriate for this scenario?

### Project Tasks:
1. **Task Management System**:
   - Users can create, update, delete tasks.
   - Task priorities, due dates, and statuses (e.g., open, closed) can be managed.
   - Authentication and authorization for users.

## üìù **Day 2 - Coding Challenges and Projects**:

### Coding Challenges:
1. **Generic Pair Class**:
   - Implement a generic class `Pair<T, U>` that can hold two objects of types T and U. Provide methods to get and set the values of the pair.

2. **Swap Method**:
   - Write a generic method `swap` that takes an array of any type and swaps the first and last elements of the array.

     - `push(T item)`
     - `T pop()`

     - `T peek()`
     - `boolean isEmpty()`
     - `int size()`

2. **Type-safe Container**:
   - Develop a type-safe container class `Container<T>` that can hold a single object of type T.
